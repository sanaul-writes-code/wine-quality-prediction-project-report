\chapter{Methodology}

This chapter describes the methodological approach adopted to investigate whether wine
quality can be predicted from measurable physicochemical properties. The methodology
aligns with the application-type structure outlined in the project report template
and encompasses data preparation, modelling strategies, and experimental design.

\section{Data Preparation}

The dataset used in this project is the UCI Wine Quality dataset, which contains
1,599 red wine samples and 4,898 white wine samples. Each instance includes
eleven physicochemical attributes (such as alcohol, density, sulphates, and pH)
and a quality score ranging from 0 to 10, based on human sensory evaluation.

Initial exploratory data analysis confirmed that the dataset contained no missing values.
Feature distributions were examined using histograms and box plots to identify unusual
patterns and potential outliers. Correlation heatmaps were generated to visualize levels
of association between each physicochemical feature and the target quality score.

Because red and white wines exhibit different chemical behavior, as illustrated by
their distinct distributions and correlations (see summary visuals provided in
the project slides), the two datasets were analyzed independently. This separation
ensures that models learn feature–quality relationships specific to each wine type.

\section{Data Processing and Pre–Modelling Steps}

All modelling experiments followed a 70/30 train–test split, as recommended for predictive
regression tasks with moderate data sizes. The split ensures that models are evaluated on
samples not used during training, providing an unbiased estimate of predictive performance.

Features were kept on their original scales for baseline experiments. For certain nonlinear
learning algorithms, scaling was optionally applied during secondary experiments to check
for improvements in performance. Visual inspection of correlations highlighted that alcohol
content had the strongest positive linear association with quality, while other features
showed moderate or weak relationships. This suggested the need for multivariate models
capable of capturing nonlinear interactions.

\section{Models and Algorithms}

Three primary machine learning models were implemented, consistent with the project’s
aim of comparing both linear and nonlinear predictive methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Regression} — Provides a baseline model to capture linear
    relationships between features and quality. It serves as a reference point for
    evaluating the necessity of more expressive models.

    \item \textbf{K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)} — A distance–based method suitable for
    detecting local structure and nonlinear feature interactions. KNN’s sensitivity
    to feature scaling was noted and considered during experiments.

    \item \textbf{Random Forest} — An ensemble model that aggregates multiple
    decision trees to learn nonlinear patterns and interactions. Random Forest
    is robust to outliers and multicollinearity, making it suitable for complex
    chemical datasets.
\end{itemize}

While not originally listed as one of the core models, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
were also explored during analysis, as indicated in the results slides. SVM achieved the best
performance for red wines, highlighting the importance of nonlinear decision boundaries.

\section{Tools and Technologies}

The following Python libraries were used to implement the methodology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pandas / NumPy}: Data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and aggregation.
    \item \textbf{Matplotlib / Seaborn}: Visualization of distributions, box plots,
    correlation matrices, and exploratory patterns used to guide modelling decisions.
    \item \textbf{Scikit–learn}: Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics
    (RMSE and \(R^2\)). Also used for splitting datasets and optional feature scaling.
\end{itemize}

The tooling supports reproducible and transparent data science workflows, aligning with
standard methodological expectations for predictive modelling tasks.

\section{Experimental Design}

Experiments were designed to benchmark the performance of each model on red and white
wine datasets separately. The evaluation relied on two common regression metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which penalizes large errors more heavily,
    and thus measures prediction reliability.
    \item \(R^2\), which quantifies the proportion of variance in wine quality
    explained by the model.
\end{itemize}

By comparing metrics across models, the methodology enabled assessment of whether
nonlinear approaches significantly outperform linear baselines. Model performance
differences between red and white wine datasets were also examined, providing insight into
whether distinct chemical profiles demand different predictive strategies.

\section{Summary}

This chapter has detailed the methodological components of the project, including data
preparation, modelling techniques, tool usage, and experimental design. The chosen
methodology supports a structured, objective investigation into the feasibility of predicting
wine quality from physicochemical features, ensuring reproducibility and alignment with
best practices in applied machine learning research.
